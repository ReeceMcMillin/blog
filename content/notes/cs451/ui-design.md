## Factors that Determine Software Usability

- **Learnability**: how easy is it to use for the first time?
  - familiarity
  - consistency
  - predictability
  - simplicity
- **Efficiency**: once users learn how to accomplish a task, how easy is it to perform?
- **Memorability**: how easy is it to use the application after not using it for a long period of time?
- **Low Error Rate**: few errors, easy to recover from errors that are made
- **Confidence and Satisfaction**: how pleasant or enjoyable is the application to use?
